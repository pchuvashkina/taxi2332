/**
 * Driver route emulator — a framework-agnostic, "dumb" route model.
 *
 * Scope of this module (tasks 1–3):
 *   1. Route model      — an ordered list of logical waypoints, the active
 *                         waypoint pointer, advancing to the next one once the
 *                         previous is reached.
 *   2. Driver movement  — moving along the road geometry, detecting waypoint
 *                         arrival, publishing an arrival notification.
 *   3. Waypoint types   — pickup / boarding / dropoff / custom.
 *
 * Design contract (agreed): this model contains NO business logic. It only
 *   - stores the logical route (a sequence of waypoints);
 *   - stores movement state and computes the current position;
 *   - builds the actual geometry through an injected `routeProvider`
 *     (it never knows whether OSRM / a way graph / anything else is used);
 *   - moves the driver and reports when a waypoint is reached.
 *
 * Everything business-level (when to change the route, whether a same-way
 * order may be taken, rebuild rules, passenger consent) is decided OUTSIDE —
 * by the UI / adapter now, by an FSM later.
 *
 * Later chunks built on top of this foundation:
 *   4. Modes (Strict/Realistic/Manual) gate how change requests are handled.
 *   5. Full mutation API — replaceRoute / appendWaypoint / insertWaypoint /
 *      removeWaypoint, all mode-governed; structural edits preserve travel
 *      progress by re-projecting the current position onto the new geometry.
 *   6. External event ingestion — `dispatch(event)` only RE-TRANSMITS world
 *      events (it never mutates the route); the activeOrders/readyOrders →
 *      events mapping lives in a separate adapter (driverOrderEventAdapter).
